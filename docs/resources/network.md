# zerotier_network (Resource)

Network provider for ZeroTier, allows you to create ZeroTier networks.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "zerotier_network" "my_network" {
  name        = "<required>"
  description = "Managed by Terraform"

  assign_ipv4 {
    zerotier = true
  }

  assign_ipv6 {
    zerotier = true
    sixplane = false
    rfc4193  = false
  }

  enable_broadcast = true
  private          = false
  flow_rules       = "accept;"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) The name of the network

### Optional

- **assign_ipv4** (Map of Boolean) IPv4 Assignment RuleSets
- **assign_ipv6** (Map of Boolean) IPv6 Assignment RuleSets
- **assignment_pool** (Block Set) Rules regarding IPv4 and IPv6 assignments (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--assignment_pool))
- **description** (String) The description of the network
- **enable_broadcast** (Boolean) Enable broadcast packets on the network
- **flow_rules** (String) The layer 2 flow rules to apply to packets traveling across this network. Please see https://www.zerotier.com/manual/#3_4_1 for more information.
- **multicast_limit** (Number) Maximum number of recipients per multicast or broadcast. Warning - Setting this to 0 will disable IPv4 communication on your network!
- **private** (Boolean) Whether or not the network is private.  If false, members will *NOT* need to be authorized to join.
- **route** (Block Set) A ipv4 or ipv6 network route (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--route))

### Read-Only

- **creation_time** (Number) The time at which this network was created, in epoch seconds
- **id** (String) ZeroTier's internal network identifier, aka NetworkID
- **tf_last_updated** (Number) The time at which this terraform was last updated, in epoch seconds

<a id="nestedblock--assignment_pool"></a>
### Nested Schema for `assignment_pool`

Optional:

- **cidr** (String) An address range in CIDR notation. This must have no other keys assigned to this block as CIDR denotes the start and end address automatically
- **end** (String) The last address in the assignment rule. This must be the highest number in the pool. end must also be accompanied by start.
- **start** (String) The first address in the assignment rule. This must be the lowest number in the pool. `start` must also be accompanied by `end`.


<a id="nestedblock--route"></a>
### Nested Schema for `route`

Required:

- **target** (String) Network to route for

Optional:

- **via** (String) Gateway address

## Import

Networks can be imported using their ID, e.g.

```
$ terraform import zerotier_network.network 8056c2e21c1930be
```
